# Here's an example of a 'snacks' method that returns the meal choice passed in to it and defaults to "cheetos" if nothing is passed in.

def snacks(food="Cheetos")
  puts "Any time, is the right time for #{food}!"
end

def breakfast(food="frosted flakes")
  puts "Morning is the best time for #{food}!"
end

def lunch(food="grilled cheese")
  puts "Lunch is the best time for #{food}!"
end

def dinner(food="salmon")
  puts "Dinner is the best time for #{food}!"
end

  puts snacks("candy")
  puts breakfast("cheerios")
  puts lunch("pizza")
  puts dinner("pasta")
